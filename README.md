# 🍽️ Recipe Recognition App with Streamlit
An AI-powered, Streamlit-based web application that identifies recipes from uploaded food images and provides step-by-step preparation details. Built using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and deep learning, this tool helps users quickly discover and recreate delicious dishes with ease.

## 🔍 Overview
Finding a recipe from just an image can be challenging — but not anymore! The Recipe Recognition App uses advanced image recognition to detect dishes and instantly provide:

✅ Recipe names and descriptions
✅ Required ingredients with quantities
✅ Step-by-step cooking instructions
✅ Nutritional information (optional)

## 🚀 Key Features
📂 Image-based Recipe Detection
Upload a food image, and the app automatically predicts the dish name and retrieves its recipe.

📊 Ingredient & Instruction Display
Shows a neatly organized list of ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions.

🔎 Search & Explore Mode
Search for recipes by name or ingredient if you don’t have a picture.

📷 Multiple Image Support (optional)
Upload multiple images at once for batch recipe recognition.

💡 Clean, Intuitive Interface
Built with Streamlit to ensure a smooth, minimal, and responsive user experience.
